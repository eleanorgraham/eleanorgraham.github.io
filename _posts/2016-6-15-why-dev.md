## Why did I decide to learn software development?

One answer is that it feels good. My particular blend of curiosity, creativity, and analytical thought lends itself to the puzzles of a developer. 

The next answer is that I am a mother. Not only that â€” I am mother to a young daughter. I want to participate in shaping her world. I can show her what it looks like to challenge myself, learn, and grow. I can show her that we can do more than be passive users of technolgy; we can build and shape it. I can show her that diversity matters. I can help her learn to write her own narrative. 

Finally, I want to feel satisfied at the end of the day. I want to know the I've collaborated and accomplished something I care about. I want to love my work and have it support my family. I think I can find that in software development. So I'm learning.
