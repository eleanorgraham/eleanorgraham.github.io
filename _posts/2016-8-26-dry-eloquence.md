# DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
Programmers talk about the virtues of DRY code, as opposed to WET (We Enjoy Typing! Write Everything Twice!). The virtue goes beyond funny acronyms: code that eliminates unnecessary repetition is easier for an outsider to read and understand. It's also easier to extend functionality as the program grows.

# Understanding vs Doing
Understanding the value of writing DRY code, and actually doing it are two different things. Although I long for simple and eloquent code, usually my first solutions are anything but DRY. And this may be a good thing.

When I was in high school I remember a math teacher getting frustrated with me for not writing enough steps in my solutions - "Show your work!" Some of the steps seemed so simple I couldn't bring myself to write them down -- I could already see several steps ahead, and at the time I felt embarrassed to show such elementary 'extra' work. Not only did I frustrate my teacher with this stubbornness, but I made things more difficult for myself: when things didn't turn out as planned, it was harder to catch mistakes in the assumptions that I had left unwritten.

# The (WET) road to DRY
When I try getting too far ahead of myself with coding I end up tangling things up. If I can allow myself to 'write everything twice' just to get initial tests passing, I usually have a much easier time simplifying from there. Starting out WET is only a problem if you never dry off.
