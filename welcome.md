Hello! My name is Eleanor. I am a Maker, Musician, and Mother.  My current home is Staunton, VA, USA: I am a collaborator at [The Kettle](http://www.the-kettle.co/), maker at the [Staunton Makerspace](http://www.stauntonmakerspace.com/), and data-loving staff member at the [Staunton Creative Community Fund](http://stauntonfund.org/). This is a magical part of the world and I am delighted to be here.

This website is where I write about my current projects and learning process. Follow along for thoughts on tech, diversity, the arts, and family.


## Welcome to my digital home
