I learned about 100 Days of Commits just a few days before it began.

I decided to join in without giving it much thought. Now, 12 days in, I'd like to reflect a bit.

# Yay

First, Hooray! 13 days in a row of commits is probably twice as long as any previous streak for me. Already I've learned a lot, even with my completely haphazard unplanned approach.

# Learning

Jumping in with no planning means that I've been forced to go with low hanging fruit.
