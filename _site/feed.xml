        <title>The Texture of Home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/eleanorgraham/cirdsie72000lg9ng6g9d088g/static/-79.115266,38.142616,11.26,0.00,0.00/600x600?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmdyYWhhbSIsImEiOiJjaW93NTR0ZHIwMWVmdWVtNXl5aTZqcW5tIn0.jSLqL9vRKByhoSH9l8E7qA&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;A Mapbox map of Staunton, VA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;birds-eye-view&quot;&gt;Bird’s Eye View&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved riding in planes. I love looking at the patchwork below, seeing if I can identify any parts of the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this map reminds me of that. How the the reaching tendrils of country roads spread from central veins; how the denser grid forms, showing a patch of city… It has a texture. I want to touch it like a quilt – feel the grooves with my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/eleanorgraham/cirdsie72000lg9ng6g9d088g/static/-79.080000,38.147000,12.83,0.00,0.00/600x600@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmdyYWhhbSIsImEiOiJjaW93NTR0ZHIwMWVmdWVtNXl5aTZqcW5tIn0.jSLqL9vRKByhoSH9l8E7qA&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;A closer view of the Staunton, VA Mapbox map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming in, I look for my house. I can see the shapes. I recognize the little slip of a street we live on. I see the broader strokes all around us. I find the curves and contours mesmerizing. The grids shift around our hills. The streets and rails converge. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps above are my first foray into playing with my own styling in Mapbox. It’s really fun. I can’t wait to dig in more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mapping Home</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-topography&quot;&gt;Personal Topography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://api.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.outdoors/-79.0717,38.1496,13/600x300@2x.png?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmdyYWhhbSIsImEiOiJjaW93NTR0ZHIwMWVmdWVtNXl5aTZqcW5tIn0.jSLqL9vRKByhoSH9l8E7qA&quot; alt=&quot;Mapbox Map of -79.0717, 38.1496&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of so much of my personal history in terms of maps. The worn map I used when I lived in Berlin to pick my bike routes. The tourist map of Prague that magically showed me the tiny street I needed. The map in the kitchen at my grandparent’s house in Hull, showing the beach where we swam and the harbor that we could see out the window…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to start telling the stories of these maps. It’s a two-fold project. On the technical side, I want to experiment with new tools – design and build the maps in my imagination. On a personal level, I want to capture some of these stories. I want to explore the places of my memory in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are. Staunton is my home now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://api.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.outdoors/-79.0717,38.1450,15/600x300@2x.png?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmdyYWhhbSIsImEiOiJjaW93NTR0ZHIwMWVmdWVtNXl5aTZqcW5tIn0.jSLqL9vRKByhoSH9l8E7qA&quot; alt=&quot;Mapbox Map of -79.0717, 38.1450&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small map contains the streets where I make my home and do my work; the bridge I walk over and the farmer’s market where I buy veggies; the shops and restaurants around my home… There is so much significance for me within the contours of these lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you can’t see it yet. But I’ll show you. Soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Strength in Diversity</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheers-to-women-in-tech&quot;&gt;Cheers to Women In Tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent episode of Front End Happy Hour is all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/raise-your-glass-to-women-in-tech/&quot;&gt;Women In Tech&lt;/a&gt; – a topic near and dear to my heart. There was a lot of talk about unconscious bias and ways to encourage diversity. It was good to hear the group agree wholeheartedly that increasing diversity in tech leads to more perspectives, greater innovation, and all around better products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-does-diversity-look-like&quot;&gt;What does Diversity look like?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s explore this. What does it look like for an existing company to develop this promised strength in diversity? It takes more than talk. It takes more than hiring a token #{diverse_person}. There needs to be a shift in culture – a true embrace of the challenges that come with diversification…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While diversity is proven to yield wonderful results, no one said it would be easy. Homogeneity usually feels easier – if everyone thinks in the same way, that often leads to speedy consensus. The fastest route may not be the best, however. In this case, it’s important to work through any potential discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a true embrace of diversity a company is saying that they want more perspectives, more ideas. This means teams need to develop respectful processes for working through different opinions and finding ways forward. Team members need to develop open minds and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company can only benefit from diverse perspectives if it makes them truly welcome in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I love Amethyst</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;adventures-with-an-automatic-tiling-window-manager&quot;&gt;Adventures with an automatic tiling window manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone new to web development, I was overwhelmed by the number of windows necessary for basic tasks. All the juggling! Switching back and forth between windows; sizing them so that I could work; placing them where they wouldn’t get lost underneath one another… It felt like an irritating waste of time and energy — lots of clicking and lag — especially when things changed (maybe this window should be bigger now, but maybe that throws off the whole organizing system)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an ideal workspace would include multiple large monitors so that I could stretch out — but that’s not always an option. Even if I could set up some sprawling workspace at home, I also like to be able to work elsewhere. So. Enter: an automatic tiling window manager. Imagine something that would automatically place your windows on the screen for you, side by side, so that you can see everything. Imagine being able to change layouts, focus, sizes, etc. all with simple key commands. It’s magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst&quot;&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t tried any of the other ones because I’m so satisfied with how Amethyst supports my workflow. Let me give you a little tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four different layouts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tall&quot;&gt;Tall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7338/28134638695_7b50523f55.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tall Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wide&quot;&gt;Wide&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7546/28134639215_126d1a534a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wide Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;fullscreen&quot;&gt;Fullscreen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7401/27853357720_2f64d2c0ef.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fullscreen Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;column&quot;&gt;Column&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7308/28134638355_9beceed7f8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Column Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— all of which you can easily switch between with key commands. When you open a window it automatically swoops into position, arranging itself amongst the others according to the layout you’ve chosen. Shift + Option + Space will cycle you through all possible layouts when you want to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to spend the most time in the Tall layout. When I’m there sometimes I want my main window at the left to be larger: Shift + Option + l&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7318/28030885452_d1c0d8470b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tall-left Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and sometimes I want the other windows on the right to be larger: Shift + Option + h&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7393/27853358400_af96403ed1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tall-right Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also shift my focus with key commands. Say I’m editing my text in sublime text and I want to shift my focus to the browser to refresh and see my work. Shift + Option + k moves focus clockwise and Shift + Option + j moves focus counter clockwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more commands — ones for changing which window is in the main slot, etc. I suggest getting used to a few key commands first and then expanding from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m amazed at how easily I have come to rely on this, and how frustrating it feels to be on a machine that doesn’t have it. Having an automatic tiling window manager feels like having a personal assistant dedicated to keeping me in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to learning!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>why dev?</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photos&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-i-decide-to-learn-software-development&quot;&gt;Why did I decide to learn software development?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer is that it feels good. My particular blend of curiosity, creativity, and analytical thought lends itself to the puzzles of a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next answer is that I am a mother. Not only that — I am mother to a young daughter. I want to participate in shaping her world. I can show her what it looks like to challenge myself, learn, and grow. I can show her that we can do more than be passive users of technolgy; we can build and shape it. I can show her that diversity matters. I can help her learn to write her own narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to feel satisfied at the end of the day. I want to know the I’ve collaborated and accomplished something I care about. I want to love my work and have it support my family. I think I can find that in software development. So I’m learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We&#39;re Live!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;commit&quot;&gt;Commit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing with Jekyll almost a month ago. Today I decided that it was time to make this experiment public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I had a blogger blog, and then moved on to wordpress with my own url. For a while I had fun with wordpress, modifying templates and playing around with periodic redesigns…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 2013 I became dissatisfied. I wanted to understand what was going on underneath. I wanted to build my own structures. And I wasn’t too sure about what I wanted public anymore either. So I tore down my wordpress site and put up a single static page. It looked like &lt;a href=&quot;/landing.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My site sat like that until February 2016, when I decided to move it and host my site on Github. It still looked the same, but I knew the difference. I knew that I was getting ready to start experimenting again, and this was the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;today&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we are today. Jekyll up and running. I am buzzing with ideas of how I want to modify and build this space. It feels good and creative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day Two</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back. I’m challenging myself to post often; to find a rhythm, establish a workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back I was following along with Sarah J Bray and her Hot Dates with your website curriculum. One of her characters was “Mo” - Momentum. It’s time for me to get reaquainted with Mo. Inertia is deadly. If I’m already in motion, I don’t need to waste energy on getting moving – I can focus on direction and style and any number of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
